Their inactive members, iRhom in Drosophila melanogaster and iRhom1 and iRhom2 in mammals, lack the catalytic center and are hence labelled “inactive” rhomboid family members. In mammals, both iRhoms are involved in maturation and trafficking of the ubiquitous transmembrane protease a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 17, which through cleaving many biologically active molecules has a critical role in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF$\alpha$), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Notch signaling. Accordingly, with iRhom2 having a profound influence on ADAM17 activation and substrate specificity it regulates these signaling pathways. Moreover, iRhom2 has a role in the innate immune response to both RNA and DNA viruses and in regulation of keratin subtype expression in wound healing and cancer. Here we review the role of iRhom2 in immunity and disease, both dependent and independent of its regulation of ADAM17.},

There is a rapidly growing body of evidence that these pseudoenzymes have a central function in regulating inflammatory and growth factor signalling and consequent roles in many diseases. iRhom pseudoproteases have evolved new domains from their proteolytic ancestors, which are integral to their modular regulation and functions. Although we cannot yet conclude the full extent of their molecular and cellular mechanisms, there is a clearly emerging theme that they regulate the stability and trafficking of other membrane proteins. In the best understood case, iRhoms act as regulatory cofactors of the ADAM17 protease, controlling its function of shedding cytokines and growth factors. It seems likely that as the involvement of iRhoms in human diseases is increasingly recognized, they will become the focus of pharmaceutical interest, and here we discuss what is known about their molecular mechanisms and relevance in known pathologies.},

in animals, facilitating bacterial quorum sensing, regulating mitochondrial homeostasis, and dismantling adhesion complexes of parasitic protozoa. Although
in no organism has the full complement of rhomboid function yet been elucidated, links to devastating human disease are emerging rapidly, including to Parkinson’s disease, type II diabetes, cancer, and bacterial and malaria infection.

abstract = {iRhoms are closely related to rhomboid intramembrane proteases but lack catalytic activity. In mammals iRhoms are known to regulate the trafficking of TACE, the protease that cleaves the membrane bound inflammatory cytokine TNF. We have mapped a spontaneously occurring mouse mutation with a loss of hair phenotype, curly bare (cub), to the Rhbdf2 locus, which encodes the iRhom2 protein. The cub deletion removes the first 268 amino acids of the iRhom2 protein but is not a loss of function. We have also identified a previously reported suppressor of cub, called Mcub (modifier of curly bare), and find it to be a loss of function allele of the amphiregulin gene (Areg). Amphiregulin is an activating ligand of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that, like TNF, is released by TACE. Our results therefore imply a regulatory link between iRhoms and EGFR signalling in mammals. We have tested the model that the cub mutation leads to iRhom2 hyperactivity and consequently excess TACE processing of amphiregulin and elevated EGFR signalling. Our results do not support this hypothesis: we find that, compared to wild-type cells, cub mutant embryonic fibroblasts release less amphiregulin, and that the cub mutant form of iRhom2 is less able than wild type to bind to TACE and promote its maturation.},

A hallmark feature of ADAM17-dependent EGFR ligand shedding is that it can be rapidly and posttranslationally activated in a manner that requires its transmembrane domain but not its cytoplasmic domain. This suggests that ADAM17 is regulated by other integral membrane proteins, although much remains to be learned about the underlying mechanism. Recently, inactive Rhomboid 2 (iRhom2), which has seven transmembrane domains, emerged as a molecule that controls the maturation and function of ADAM17 in myeloid cells. However, iRhom2{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-/-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} mice appear normal, raising questions about how ADAM17 is regulated in other tissues. Here we report that iRhom1/2{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-/-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} double knockout mice resemble Adam17{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-/-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and Egfr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-/-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} mice in that they die perinatally with open eyes, misshapen heart valves, and growth plate defects. Mechanistically, we show lack of mature ADAM17 and strongly reduced EGFR phosphorylation in iRhom1/2{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-/-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} tissues. Finally, we demonstrate that iRhom1 is not essential for mouse development but regulates ADAM17 maturation in the brain, except in microglia, where ADAM17 is controlled by iRhom2. These results provide genetic, cell biological, and biochemical evidence that a principal function of iRhoms1/2 during mouse development is to regulate ADAM17-dependent EGFR signaling, suggesting that iRhoms1/2 could emerge as novel targets for treatment of ADAM17/EGFR-dependent pathologies.},

However, little is known about the physiological substrates for iRhom2 or the molecular mechanisms underlying these functions. We show that iRhom2 is a short-lived protein whose stability can be increased by select mutations in the N-terminal domain. In turn, these stable variants function to augment the secretion of EGF family ligands, including amphiregulin, independent of metallo-protease a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) activity. In vivo, N-terminal iRhom2 mutations induce accelerated wound healing as well as accelerated tumorigenesis, but they do not drive spontaneous tumor development. This work underscores the physiological prominence of iRhom2 in controlling EGFR signaling events involved in wound healing and neoplastic growth, and yields insight into the function of key iRhom2 domains.},

AREG, synthesized as a propeptide, requires conversion to an active peptide by metalloproteases by a process known as ectodomain shedding. Although (ADAM17) a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 is a key sheddase of AREG, ADAM8-, ADAM15-, and batimastat (broad metalloprotease inhibitor)-sensitive metalloproteases have also been implicated in AREG shedding. In the present study, using a curly bare (Rhbdf2cub) mouse model that shows loss-of-hair, enlarged sebaceous gland, and rapid cutaneous wound-healing phenotypes mediated by enhanced Areg mRNA and protein levels, we sought to identify the principal ectodomain sheddase of AREG. To this end, we generated Rhbdf2cub mice lacking ADAM17 specifically in the skin and examined the above phenotypes of Rhbdf2cub mice. We find that ADAM17 deficiency in the skin of Rhbdf2cub mice restores a full hair coat, prevents sebaceous gland enlargement, and impairs the rapid wound-healing phenotype observed in Rhbdf2cub mice. Furthermore, in vitro, stimulated shedding of AREG is abolished in Rhbdf2cub mouse embryonic keratinocytes lacking ADAM17. Thus, our data support previous findings demonstrating that ADAM17 is the major ectodomain sheddase of AREG.},

Apart from the resulting inflammatory defects, iRhom2-null mice appear normal: they do not show the several defects seen in TACE knockouts, suggesting that TACE maturation is independent of iRhom2 in cells other than macrophages. Here we show that the physiological role of iRhoms is much broader. iRhom1 knockout mice die within 6 weeks of birth. They show a severe phenotype, with defects in several tissues including highly penetrant brain haemorrhages. The non-overlapping phenotypes imply that iRhom 1 and 2 have distinct physiological roles, although at a cellular level both promote the maturation of TACE (but not other ADAM proteases). Both iRhoms are co-expressed in many contexts where TACE acts. We conclude that all TACE activity, constitutive and regulated, requires iRhom function. iRhoms are therefore essential and specific regulators of TACE activity, but our evidence also implies that they must have additional physiologically important clients. {\textcopyright} 2013 European Molecular Biology Organization.},

Bombesin/GRP antagonists, RC-3095 and RC-3940-II, were administered subcutaneously twice daily at a dose of 10 µg for 5 weeks. The growth of MDA-MB-231 tumours was inhibited during the treatment, as shown by a reduction in tumour volume. RC-3940-II and RC-3095 significantly decreased the final tumour volume by 72.4% and 57.7%, respectively, and greatly reduced tumour weights. RC-3940-II also significantly increased tumour doubling time and appeared to be more effective than RC-3095 in inhibiting the growth of MDA-MB-231 breast cancers. Serum gastrin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels in animals treated with RC-3095 or RC-3940-II showed no significant changes as compared with controls. There was a significant decrease in the number of binding sites for epidermal growth factor (EGF), as well as bombesin, in tumour cells after chronic treatment with RC-3095 or RC-3940-II, which might be related to inhibition of tumour growth. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, followed by Southern blot analysis, also showed a reduction in the expression of mRNA for EGF receptors in the group treated with RC-3940-II. Our findings suggest that bombesin/GRP antagonists such as RC-3095 or RC-3940-II could be considered for endocrine therapy for oestrogen-independent breast cancers, but further investigations are necessary.},

EGF is moreover a substrate of RHBDL2, their active Rhomboid relative. Other substrates of RHBDL2 include members of the EphrinB family and thrombomodulin. RHBDL2 has also previously been demonstrated to be important in wound healing in cutaneous keratinocytes through the cleavage of thrombomodulin.

abstract = {Background: The renal tubules, which have distant metabolic features and functions in different segments, reabsorb {\textgreater}99{\%} of approximately 180 l of water and 25,000 mmol of Na + daily. Defective metabolism in renal tubules is involved in the pathobiology of kidney diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying the metabolic regulation in renal tubules remain to be defined. Methods: We quantitatively compared the proteomes of the isolated proximal tubules (PT) and distal tubules (DT) from C57BL/6 mouse using tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling-based quantitative mass spectrometry. Bioinformatics analysis of the differentially expressed proteins revealed the significant differences between PT and DT in metabolism pathway. We also performed in vitro and in vivo assays to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the distant metabolic features in PT and DT. Findings: We demonstrate that the renal proximal tubule (PT) has high expression of lipid metabolism enzymes, which is transcriptionally upregulated by abundantly expressed PPAR$\alpha$/$\gamma$. In contrast, the renal distal tubule (DT) has elevated glycolytic enzyme expression, which is mediated by highly expressed c-Myc. Importantly, PPAR$\gamma$ transcriptionally enhances the protease iRhom2 expression in PT, which suppresses EGF expression and secretion and subsequent EGFR-dependent glycolytic gene expression and glycolysis. PPAR$\gamma$ inhibition reduces iRhom2 expression and increases EGF and GLUT1 expression in PT in mice, resulting in renal tubule hypertrophy, tubulointerstitial fibrosis and damaged kidney functions, which are rescued by 2-deoxy-D-glucose treatment. Interpretation: These findings delineate instrumental mechanisms underlying the active lipid metabolism and suppressed glycolysis in PT and active glycolysis in DT and reveal critical roles for PPARs and c-Myc in maintaining renal metabolic homeostasis.

abstract = {Rhomboid pseudoproteases are catalytically inactive members of the rhomboid superfamily. The founding members, rhomboids, were first identified in Drosophila as serine intramembrane proteases that cleave transmembrane proteins, enabling signaling. This led to the discovery of the wider rhomboid superfamily, a clan that in metazoans is dominated by pseudoproteases. These so-called rhomboid pseudoproteases inherited from their catalytically active ancestors a conserved rhomboid-like domain and a propensity to regulate signaling. Lacking catalytic activity, they developed new ‘pseudoenzyme' functions that include regulating the trafficking, turnover, and activity of their client proteins. Rhomboid pseudoproteases have preeminent roles in orchestrating immune cell activation, antiviral responses, and cytokine release in response to microbial infection, or in chronic diseases, and have also been implicated in growth factor signaling, cancer, and, more recently, metabolism. Here, we discuss the mechanism(s) of action of rhomboid pseudoproteases, contrasted with rhomboid proteases. We also highlight the roles of rhomboid pseudoproteases in mammalian physiology, which, quite paradoxically among pseudoenzymes, is understood much better than active rhomboids.},

abstract = {The metalloproteinase ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17) controls EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling by liberating EGFR ligands from their membrane anchor. Consequently, a patient lacking ADAM17 has skin and intestinal barrier defects that are likely caused by lack of EGFR signaling, and Adam17(-/-) mice die perinatally with open eyes, like Egfr(-/-) mice. A hallmark feature of ADAM17-dependent EGFR ligand shedding is that it can be rapidly and posttranslationally activated in a manner that requires its transmembrane domain but not its cytoplasmic domain. This suggests that ADAM17 is regulated by other integral membrane proteins, although much remains to be learned about the underlying mechanism. Recently, inactive Rhomboid 2 (iRhom2), which has seven transmembrane domains, emerged as a molecule that controls the maturation and function of ADAM17 in myeloid cells. However, iRhom2(-/-) mice appear normal, raising questions about how ADAM17 is regulated in other tissues. Here we report that iRhom1/2(-/-) double knockout mice resemble Adam17(-/-) and Egfr(-/-) mice in that they die perinatally with open eyes, misshapen heart valves, and growth plate defects. Mechanistically, we show lack of mature ADAM17 and strongly reduced EGFR phosphorylation in iRhom1/2(-/-) tissues. Finally, we demonstrate that iRhom1 is not essential for mouse development but regulates ADAM17 maturation in the brain, except in microglia, where ADAM17 is controlled by iRhom2. These results provide genetic, cell biological, and biochemical evidence that a principal function of iRhoms1/2 during mouse development is to regulate ADAM17-dependent EGFR signaling, suggesting that iRhoms1/2 could emerge as novel targets for treatment of ADAM17/EGFR-dependent pathologies.},

abstract = {The rhomboid 5 homolog 2 (Rhbdf2) gene encodes an inactive rhomboid (iRhom) protease, iRhom2, one of a family of enzymes containing a long cytosolic N terminus and a dormant peptidase domain of unknown function. iRhom2 has been implicated in epithelial regeneration and cancer growth through constitutive activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. However, little is known about the physiological substrates for iRhom2 or the molecular mechanisms underlying these functions. We show that iRhom2 is a short-lived protein whose stability can be increased by select mutations in the N-terminal domain. In turn, these stable variants function to augment the secretion of EGF family ligands, including amphiregulin, independent of metalloprotease a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) activity. In vivo, N-terminal iRhom2 mutations induce accelerated wound healing as well as accelerated tumorigenesis, but they do not drive spontaneous tumor development. This work underscores the physiological prominence of iRhom2 in controlling EGFR signaling events involved in wound healing and neoplastic growth, and yields insight into the function of key iRhom2 domains.},

abstract = {Several proteins in the iRhom family function as oncogenic regulators in certain cancers. However, the function of these proteins in cervical cancer (CC) is unknown. The relationship of iRhom1 and iRhom2 expression with the clinicopathological features and prognosis of patients with CC was investigated, and their possible molecular mechanisms were examined using in vitro experiments. The expression of iRhom1 and iRhom2 in CC samples of 83 patients was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the associations of their expression with the clinicopathological features of patients were determined. The relationship of iRhom1, iRhom2, and Ki‑67 expression with survival rates was determined using Kaplan‑Meier analysis and Cox regression analyses. HeLa cells were analyzed using MTT assays, cell cycle analysis, and apoptosis assays. The results revealed that CC tissues had higher levels of iRhom1 and iRhom2 than adjacent normal tissues. Increased expression of iRhom1, iRhom2, and K‑i67 was significantly associated with tumor stage, size, and parametrium invasion. High expression of iRhom1, iRhom2 and Ki‑67 was correlated with poor outcomes. Cancer stage and iRhom2 expression were independent prognostic indicators of CC. Knockdown of iRhom1 and iRhom2 in HeLa cells inhibited cell proliferation, promoted the G1 phase and relieved S‑phase arrest, and induced apoptosis. Genomic microarray analysis indicated that iRhom2 knockdown altered several pathways with roles in oncogenesis, including the expression of five genes in the Wnt/$\beta$‑catenin pathway. Western blotting in HeLa cells revealed that iRhom1 knockdown significantly suppressed the expression of $\beta$‑catenin, Myc, p‑EGFR and TGFBR2, and increased the expression of FAS; iRhom2 knockdown significantly suppressed the expression of $\beta$‑catenin, GSK3$\beta$, p‑EGFR and Myc. These results were consistent with the genomic microarray data. Collectively, the results indicated that iRhom1 and iRhom2 may function as oncogenes in CC and are potential therapeutic targets. },

abstract = {Cells with higher levels of Myc proliferate more rapidly and supercompetitively eliminate neighboring cells. Nonetheless, tumor cells in aggressive breast cancers typically exhibit significant and stable heterogeneity in their Myc levels, which correlates with refractoriness to therapy and poor prognosis. This suggests that Myc heterogeneity confers some selective advantage on breast tumor growth and progression. To investigate this, we created a traceable MMTV-Wnt1-driven in vivo chimeric mammary tumor model comprising an admixture of low-Myc- and reversibly switchable high-Myc-expressing clones. We show that such tumors exhibit interclonal mutualism wherein cells with high-Myc expression facilitate tumor growth by promoting protumorigenic stroma yet concomitantly suppress Wnt expression, which renders them dependent for survival on paracrine Wnt provided by low-Myc-expressing clones. To identify any therapeutic vulnerabilities arising from such interdependency, we modeled Myc/Ras/p53/Wnt signaling cross talk as an executable network for low-Myc, for high-Myc clones, and for the 2 together. This executable mechanistic model replicated the observed interdependence of high-Myc and low-Myc clones and predicted a pharmacological vulnerability to coinhibition of COX2 and MEK. This was confirmed experimentally. Our study illustrates the power of executable models in elucidating mechanisms driving tumor heterogeneity and offers an innovative strategy for identifying combination therapies tailored to the oligoclonal landscape of heterogenous tumors.},

To understand the dynamics of genomic alterations in this progression, we used four multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization probe panels consisting of the oncogenes COX2, MYC, HER2, CCND1, and ZNF217 and the tumor suppressor genes DBC2, CDH1, and TP53 to visualize copy number changes in 13 cases of synchronous DCIS and IDC based on single-cell analyses. The DCIS had a lower degree of chromosomal instability than the IDC. Despite enormous intercellular heterogeneity in DCIS and IDC, we observed signal patterns consistent with a nonrandom distribution of genomic imbalances. CDH1 was most commonly lost, and gain of MYC emerged during progression from DCIS to IDC. Four of 13 DCISs showed identical clonal imbalances in the IDCs. Six cases revealed a switch, and in four of those, the IDC had acquired a gain of MYC. In one case, the major clone in the IDC was one of several clones in the DCIS, and in another case, the major clone in the DCIS became one of the two major clones in the IDC. Despite considerable chromosomal instability, in most cases the evolution from DCIS to IDC is determined by recurrent patterns of genomic imbalances, consistent with a biological continuum. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Society for Investigative Pathology.},

abstract = {The two oncogenes KRas and Myc cooperate to drive tumorigenesis, but the mechanism underlying this remains unclear. In a mouse lung model of KRasG12D-driven adenomas, we find that co-activation of Myc drives the immediate transition to highly proliferative and invasive adenocarcinomas marked by highly inflammatory, angiogenic, and immune-suppressed stroma. We identify epithelial-derived signaling molecules CCL9 and IL-23 as the principal instructing signals for stromal reprogramming. CCL9 mediates recruitment of macrophages, angiogenesis, and PD-L1-dependent expulsion of T and B cells. IL-23 orchestrates exclusion of adaptive T and B cells and innate immune NK cells. Co-blockade of both CCL9 and IL-23 abrogates Myc-induced tumor progression. Subsequent deactivation of Myc in established adenocarcinomas triggers immediate reversal of all stromal changes and tumor regression, which are independent of CD4+CD8+ T cells but substantially dependent on returning NK cells. We show that Myc extensively programs an immune suppressive stroma that is obligatory for tumor progression. Oncogenic Myc activity orchestrates an immune suppressive tumor microenvironment.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Many intercellular signals are synthesised as transmembrane precursors that are released by proteolytic cleavage (‘shedding') from the cell surface. ADAM17, a membrane-tethered metalloprotease, is the primary shedding enzyme responsible for the release of the inflammatory cytokine TNF$\alpha$ and several EGF receptor ligands. ADAM17 exists in complex with the rhomboid-like iRhom proteins, which act as cofactors that regulate ADAM17 substrate shedding. Here we report that the poorly characterised FERM domain-containing protein FRMD8 is a new component of the iRhom2/ADAM17 sheddase complex. FRMD8 binds to the cytoplasmic N-terminus of iRhoms and is necessary to stabilise iRhoms and ADAM17 at the cell surface. In the absence of FRMD8, iRhom2 and ADAM17 are degraded via the endolysosomal pathway, resulting in the reduction of ADAM17-mediated shedding. We have confirmed the pathophysiological significance of FRMD8 in iPSC-derived human macrophages and mouse tissues, thus demonstrating its role in the regulated release of multiple cytokine and growth factor signals.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To investigate molecular heterogeneity of primary breast cancer specimens, we determined the amplification status of growth regulatory genes (c-erbB2, topoisomerase II$\alpha$, c-myc, and cyclinD1) in macroscopically and microscopically separate areas of individual tumors (n = 21). Using laser-assisted microdissection and quantitative PCR, we found marked intratumoral heterogeneity with different patterns for each gene. Molecular heterogeneity in amplification pattern could be demonstrated between both macroscopically (0.5 to several centimeters) and microscopically (10 to several hundred micrometers) distant tumor areas. C-erbB2 amplification proved to be the most stable amplification in individual tumors, with heterogeneity occurring in only 36{\%} of amplified cases. By contrast, amplification of c-myc and cyclinD1 revealed varying patterns in the vast majority of amplified cases (100{\%} and 83{\%}). The constancy of c-erbB2 amplification underlines its presumed importance in breast cancer biology. We conclude that the molecular heterogeneity of breast cancer as evidenced in this study requires thorough and representative sampling of different tumor areas when the biologic significance of somatic mutations is considered. Patterns of heterogeneity can be used to trace the clonal evolution within different compartments of an individual tumor.},

abstract = {Several membrane-bound proteins with a single transmembrane domain are subjected to limited proteolysis at the cell surface. This cleavage leads to the release of their biologically active ectodomains, which can trigger different signalling pathways. In many cases, this ectodomain shedding is mediated by members of the family of a disintegrins and metalloproteinases (ADAMs). ADAM17 in particular is responsible for the cleavage of several proinflammatory mediators, growth factors, receptors and adhesion molecules. Due to its direct involvement in the release of these signalling molecules, ADAM17 can be positively and negatively involved in various physiological processes as well as in inflammatory, fibrotic and malignant pathologies. This central role of ADAM17 in a variety of processes requires strict multi-level regulation, including phosphorylation, various conformational changes and endogenous inhibitors. Recent research has shown that an early, crucial control mechanism is interaction with certain adapter proteins identified as iRhom1 and iRhom2, which are pseudoproteases of the rhomboid superfamily. Thus, iRhoms have also a decisive influence on physiological and pathophysiological signalling processes regulated by ADAM17. Their characteristic gene expression profiles, the specific consequences of gene knockouts and finally the occurrence of disease-associated mutations suggest that iRhom1 and iRhom2 undergo different gene regulation in order to fulfil their function in different cell types and are therefore only partially redundant. Therefore, there is not only interest in ADAM17, but also in iRhoms as therapeutic targets. However, to exploit the therapeutic potential, the regulation of ADAM17 activity and in particular its interaction with iRhoms must be well understood.},

In another scenario, DNMT itself is regulated by the environment carcinogens (smoke), epigenetic and genetic information.

Liberation of TNF receptors (TNFRs) from cell surfaces can dampen the cellular response to TNF, a cytokine that is critical in the innate immune response and promotes programmed cell death but can also promote sepsis. Catalytically inactive members of the rhomboid family of proteases, iRhom1 and iRhom2, mediate the intracellular transport and maturation of ADAM17. Using a genetic screen, we found that the presence of either iRhom1 or iRhom2 lacking part of their extended amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain (herein referred to as $\Delta$N) increases ADAM17 activity, TNFR shedding, and resistance to TNF-induced cell death in fibrosarcoma cells. Inhibitors of ADAM17, but not of other ADAM family members, prevented the effects of iRhom-$\Delta$N expression. iRhom1 and iRhom2 were functionally redundant, suggesting a conserved role for the iRhom amino termini. Cells from patients with a dominantly inherited cancer susceptibility syndrome called tylosis with esophageal cancer (TOC) have amino-terminal mutations in iRhom2. Keratinocytes from TOC patients exhibited increased TNFR1 shedding compared with cells from healthy donors. Our results explain how loss of the amino terminus in iRhom1 and iRhom2 impairs TNF signaling, despite enhancing ADAM17 activity, and may explain how mutations in the amino-terminal region contribute to the cancer predisposition syndrome TOC.},

During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2004-2008), overall cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6{\%} per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8{\%} per year in men and by 1.6{\%} per year in women. Over the past 10 years of available data (1999-2008), cancer death rates have declined by more than 1{\%} per year in men and women of every racial/ethnic group with the exception of American Indians/Alaska Natives, among whom rates have remained stable. The most rapid declines in death rates occurred among African American and Hispanic men (2.4{\%} and 2.3{\%} per year, respectively). Death rates continue to decline for all 4 major cancer sites (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate), with lung cancer accounting for almost 40{\%} of the total decline in men and breast cancer accounting for 34{\%} of the total decline in women. The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of about 1,024,400 deaths from cancer. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population, with an emphasis on those groups in the lowest socioeconomic bracket.},

Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,529,560 new cancer cases and 569,490 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2010. Overall cancer incidence rates decreased in the most recent time period in both men (1.3{\%} per year from 2000 to 2006) and women (0.5{\%} per year from 1998 to 2006), largely due to decreases in the 3 major cancer sites in men (lung, prostate, and colon and rectum [colorectum]) and 2 major cancer sites in women (breast and colorectum). This decrease occurred in all racial/ethnic groups in both men and women with the exception of American Indian/Alaska Native women, in whom rates were stable. Among men, death rates for all races combined decreased by 21.0{\%} between 1990 and 2006, with decreases in lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer rates accounting for nearly 80{\%} of the total decrease. Among women, overall cancer death rates between 1991 and 2006 decreased by 12.3{\%}, with decreases in breast and colorectal cancer rates accounting for 60{\%} of the total decrease. The reduction in the overall cancer death rates translates to the avoidance of approximately 767,000 deaths from cancer over the 16-year period. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year. Although progress has been made in reducing incidence and mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons younger than 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population and by supporting new discoveries in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment.},

The overall cancer death rate dropped continuously from 1991 to 2016 by a total of 27{\%}, translating into approximately 2,629,200 fewer cancer deaths than would have been expected if death rates had remained at their peak. Although the racial gap in cancer mortality is slowly narrowing, socioeconomic inequalities are widening, with the most notable gaps for the most preventable cancers. For example, compared with the most affluent counties, mortality rates in the poorest counties were 2-fold higher for cervical cancer and 40{\%} higher for male lung and liver cancers during 2012-2016. Some states are home to both the wealthiest and the poorest counties, suggesting the opportunity for more equitable dissemination of effective cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment strategies.

abstract = {The rhomboid family of genes carry out a wide range of important functions in a variety of organisms. Little is known, however, about the function of the human rhomboid family-1 gene (RHBDF1). We show here that RHBDF1 function is essential to epithelial cancer cell growth. RHBDF1 mRNA level is significantly elevated in clinical specimens of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, and the protein is readily detectable in human breast cancer or head and neck cancer cell lines. Silencing the RHBDF1 gene with short interfering RNA (siRNA) results in apoptosis in breast cancer MDA-MB-435 cells and autophagy in head and neck squamous cell cancer 1483 cells. The treatment also leads to significant down-modulation of activated AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase in the cells, suggesting that critically diminished strength of these growth signals may be the key attributes of the induction of cell death. Furthermore, silencing the RHBDF1 gene in MDA-MB-435 or 1483 xenograft tumors on athymic nude mice by using i.v. administered histidine-lysine polymer nanoparticle- encapsulated siRNA results in marked inhibition of tumor growth. Our findings indicate that RHBDF1 has a pivotal role in sustaining growth signals in epithelial cancer cells and thus may serve as a therapeutic target for treating epithelial cancers.

We can measure nodes by their network features to infer their importance in the network, and it can help us identify central elements of biological networks. Results: We introduce a novel Cytoscape plugin cytoHubba for ranking nodes in a network by their network features. CytoHubba provides 11 topological analysis methods including Degree, Edge Percolated Component, Maximum Neighborhood Component, Density of Maximum Neighborhood Component, Maximal Clique Centrality and six centralities (Bottleneck, EcCentricity, Closeness, Radiality, Betweenness, and Stress) based on shortest paths. Among the eleven methods, the new proposed method, MCC, has a better performance on the precision of predicting essential proteins from the yeast PPI network. Conclusions:CytoHubba provide a user-friendly interface to explore important nodes in biological networks. It computes all eleven methods in one stop shopping way. Besides, researchers are able to combine cytoHubba with and other plugins into a novel analysis scheme. The network and sub-networks caught by this topological analysis strategy will lead to new insights on essential regulatory networks and protein drug targets for experimental biologists. According to cytoscape plugin download statistics, the accumulated number of cytoHubba is around 6,700 times since 2010.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is evidence that genes and their protein products are organized into functional modules according to cellular processes and pathways. Gene co-expression networks have been used to describe the relationships between gene transcripts. Ample literature exists on how to detect biologically meaningful modules in networks but there is a need for methods that allow one to study the relationships between modules. RESULTS: We show that network methods can also be used to describe the relationships between co-expression modules and present the following methodology. First, we describe several methods for detecting modules that are shared by two or more networks (referred to as consensus modules). We represent the gene expression profiles of each module by an eigengene. Second, we propose a method for constructing an eigengene network, where the edges are undirected but maintain information on the sign of the co-expression information. Third, we propose methods for differential eigengene network analysis that allow one to assess the preservation of network properties across different data sets. We illustrate the value of eigengene networks in studying the relationships between consensus modules in human and chimpanzee brains; the relationships between consensus modules in brain, muscle, liver, and adipose mouse tissues; and the relationships between male-female mouse consensus modules and clinical traits. In some applications, we find that module eigengenes can be organized into higher level clusters which we refer to as meta-modules. CONCLUSION: Eigengene networks can be effective and biologically meaningful tools for studying the relationships between modules of a gene co-expression network. The proposed methods may reveal a higher order organization of the transcriptome.

abstract = {RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20{\%}-40{\%} of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to {\textgreater}85{\%} for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve {\textgreater}85{\%} for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery rate at ≲5{\%} for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that at least six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.},

We aimed to validate these novel results in an independent material by screening RHBDF2 in a previously unreported Finnish TOC family.We identified a new missense mutation, p.Asp188Asn, segregating with TOC in the Finnish family, and interestingly the detected mutation alters a codon located between the two previously reported mutation sites. Thus, we confirmed RHBDF2 mutations as the underlying cause of the TOC syndrome and our results suggest that the TOC associated mutations might be specific for this particular site in the RHBDF2 gene. These results enable the genetic counseling and diagnostic mutation screening of the members of TOC families. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.},

abstract = {Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an activated oncogene in many cancers. It can be transactivated by ligands of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We show here that a novel gene, human rhomboid family-1 (RHBDF1), which was recently reported to have a pivotal role in epithelial cancer cell growth in culture and in xenograft tumors, participates in the modulation of GPCR-mediated EGFR transactivation. The RHBDF1 protein localizes mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum. Silencing the RHBDF1 gene in head and neck squamous cancer cell line 1483 cells with siRNA causes an inhibition of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) -induced phosphorylation of EGFR and EGFR-dependent signaling proteins p44/42 MAPK and AKT, accompanied by an inhibition of GRP-induced survival, proliferation, and invasion of the cells. The EGFR signaling pathway itself remains intact, however, as the cells remain responsive to exogenous EGF. In addition, RHBDF1 gene silencing disrupts GRP-stimulated secretion of EGFR ligand TGF-alpha, but not the production of latent TGF-alpha, whereas engineered overexpression of RHBDF1 markedly accelerates the secretion of TGF-alpha. These findings are consistent with the view that RHBDF1 is critically involved in a GPCR ligand-stimulated process leading to the activation of latent EGFR ligands.},

Quality control guidelines for preclinical stroke studies have now been established. However, sufficient understanding of the underlying mechanisms of neuronal death after stroke that could be possibly translated into new therapies is lacking. One exception is the hypothesis that cellular death is mediated by oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is defined as an excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from different possible enzymatic sources. Among these, NADPH oxidases (NOX1-5) stand out as they represent the only known enzyme family that has no other function than to produce ROS. Based on data from different NOX knockout mouse models in ischemic stroke, the most relevant isoform appears to be NOX4.

abstract = {Tylosis esophageal cancer (TOC) is an autosomal-dominant syndrome characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma, oral precursor lesions, and a high lifetime risk of esophageal cancer. We have previously localized the TOC locus to a small genomic interval within chromosomal region 17q25. Using a targeted capture array and next-generation sequencing, we have now identified missense mutations (c.557T{\textgreater}C [p.Ile186Thr] and c.566C{\textgreater}T [p.Pro189Leu] in RHBDF2, which encodes the inactive rhomboid protease RHBDF2 (also known as iRhom2), as the underlying cause of TOC. We show that the distribution of RHBDF2 in tylotic skin is altered in comparison with that in normal skin, and immortalized tylotic keratinocytes have decreased levels of total epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and display an increased proliferative and migratory potential relative to normal cells, even when normal cells are stimulated with exogenous epidermal growth factor. It would thus appear that EGFR signaling is dysregulated in tylotic cells. Furthermore, we also show an altered localization of RHBDF2 in both tylotic and sporadic squamous esophageal tumors. The elucidation of a role of RHBDF2 in growth-factor signaling in esophageal cancer will help to determine whether targeting this pathway in chemotherapy for this and other squamous cell carcinomas will be effective. {\textcopyright} 2012 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We had previously established that inactivation of RUNX3 occurs by frequent promoter hypermethylation and protein mislocalization in invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC) of breast. Here, we hypothesize that inactivation of RUNX3 occurring in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) represent early event in breast carcinogenesis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The study cohort of 40 patients included 17 pure DCIS cases and 23 cases of DCIS with associated IDC (DCIS-IDC). The DCIS and IDC components of mixed cases were manually microdissected to permit separate evaluation. All the 63 samples including 17 pure DCIS, 23 samples each of DCIS and IDC of DCIS-IDC cases were analyzed for RUNX3 protein expression using R3-6E9 monoclonal antibody as well as promoter methylation status by methylation specific PCR.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Compared to matched normal breast samples (4 of 40, 10{\%}), DCIS (35 of 40, 88{\%}) and IDC (21 of 23, 91{\%}) exhibited significant RUNX3 inactivation (P{\textless}0.001) in the form of negative or weak nuclear staining. In contrast to normal breast tissues (1/10, 10{\%}), promoter hypermethylation of RUNX3 was significantly higher in the neoplastic breast samples (46 of total 61, 75{\%}) including 30 of 40 (75{\%}) DCIS and 16 of 21 (76{\%}) IDC samples (P=0.009). Overall, promoter hypermethylation correlated with RUNX3 inactivation in 42 of 46 (91{\%}) methylated samples (P=0.03). Mislocalized cytoplasmic expression also accounted for RUNX3 inactivation in majority of DCIS (33/40, 83{\%}) and IDC (20/23, 87{\%}) samples independent of promoter hypermethylation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our data suggest that RUNX3 inactivation by promoter hypermethylation and protein mislocalization constitute an early event in breast cancer progression.},

abstract = {Large-scale sequencing of genomes has revealed that most enzyme families include inactive homologues. These pseudoenzymes are often well conserved, implying a selective pressure to retain them during evolution, and therefore that they have significant function. Mechanistic insights and evolutionary lessons are now emerging from the study of a broad range of such 'dead' enzymes. The recently discovered iRhoms-inactive homologues of rhomboid proteases-have joined derlins and other members of the rhomboid-like clan in regulating the fate of proteins as they pass through the secretory pathway. There is a strong case that dead enzymes, which have been rather overlooked, may be a rich source of biological regulators. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The rhomboid family of genes carry out a wide range of important functions in a variety of organisms. Little is known, however, about the function of the human rhomboid family-1 gene (RHBDF1). We show here that RHBDF1 function is essential to epithelial cancer cell growth. RHBDF1 mRNA level is significantly elevated in clinical specimens of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, and the protein is readily detectable in human breast cancer or head and neck cancer cell lines. Silencing the RHBDF1 gene with short interfering RNA (siRNA) results in apoptosis in breast cancer MDA-MB-435 cells and autophagy in head and neck squamous cell cancer 1483 cells. The treatment also leads to significant down-modulation of activated AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase in the cells, suggesting that critically diminished strength of these growth signals may be the key attributes of the induction of cell death. Furthermore, silencing the RHBDF1 gene in MDA-MB-435 or 1483 xenograft tumors on athymic nude mice by using i.v. administered histidine-lysine polymer nanoparticle-encapsulated siRNA results in marked inhibition of tumor growth. Our findings indicate that RHBDF1 has a pivotal role in sustaining growth signals in epithelial cancer cells and thus may serve as a therapeutic target for treating epithelial cancers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Pakistan's population is ethnically diverse with distinct ethnic groups inhabiting various parts of the country. Cancer statistics obtained from specific regions populated by distinct ethnic groups may vary considerably. There is no national cancer registry. To determine whether there are indeed significant statistical differences in cancer incidence and prevalence, data was recorded from different parts of Pakistan based on the ethnic composition of the population in those parts. METHODS Ten papers (original articles) on cancer incidence and prevalence in Pakistan published in the last two decades were selected from PubMed and Google Scholar. Meta-analysis of findings of these studies was performed using Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) checklist. $\chi$2-based I2 test was used for evaluating heterogeneity and Forest plots were generated for calculating unadjusted prevalence estimates. Oral, gastric, prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers were selected for meta-analysis. I2 values of 75{\%} or greater indicated high heterogeneity. RESULTS All five types of cancer selected for meta-analysis (performed on studies carrying similar statistical weights) showed extremely high heterogeneity with I2 values of 99.7{\%} for oral cancer, 98.6{\%} for prostate cancer, 98.3{\%} for gastric cancer, 99.8{\%} for breast cancer, and 85.4{\%} for colorectal cancer. p values for all cancers were highly statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS Our findings show that the prevalence rates of different cancer types demonstrate marked variation in different studies depending on the place of origin of the study and dominant ethnic group in that region, and these variations are highly statistically significant. A national cancer registry needs to be established as soon as possible.},

abstract = {Rhomboid protease was first discovered in Drosophila. Muta- tion of the fly gene interfered with growth factor signaling and produced a characteristic phenotype of a pointed head skeleton. The name rhomboid has since been widely used to describe a large family of relatedmembraneproteins that have diverse bio- logical functions but share a common catalytic core domain composed of six membrane-spanning segments. Most rhom- boid proteases cleave membrane protein substrates near the N terminus of their transmembrane domains. How these pro- teases function within the confines of themembraneis not com- pletely understood. Recent progress in crystallographic analysis of the Escherichia coli rhomboid protease GlpG in complex with inhibitors has provided new insights into the catalytic mecha- nism of the protease and its conformational change. Improved biochemical assays have also identified a substrate sequence motif that is specifically recognized by many rhomboid proteases.},

abstract = {CONTEXT Gene expression analysis has identified several breast cancer subtypes, including basal-like, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 positive/estrogen receptor negative (HER2+/ER-), luminal A, and luminal B. OBJECTIVES To determine population-based distributions and clinical associations for breast cancer subtypes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Immunohistochemical surrogates for each subtype were applied to 496 incident cases of invasive breast cancer from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (ascertained between May 1993 and December 1996), a population-based, case-control study that oversampled premenopausal and African American women. Subtype definitions were as follows: luminal A (ER+ and/or progesterone receptor positive [PR+], HER2-), luminal B (ER+ and/or PR+, HER2+), basal-like (ER-, PR-, HER2-, cytokeratin 5/6 positive, and/or HER1+), HER2+/ER- (ER-, PR-, and HER2+), and unclassified (negative for all 5 markers). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES We examined the prevalence of breast cancer subtypes within racial and menopausal subsets and determined their associations with tumor size, axillary nodal status, mitotic index, nuclear pleomorphism, combined grade, p53 mutation status, and breast cancer-specific survival. RESULTS The basal-like breast cancer subtype was more prevalent among premenopausal African American women (39{\%}) compared with postmenopausal African American women (14{\%}) and non-African American women (16{\%}) of any age (P{\textless}.001), whereas the luminal A subtype was less prevalent (36{\%} vs 59{\%} and 54{\%}, respectively). The HER2+/ER- subtype did not vary with race or menopausal status (6{\%}-9{\%}). Compared with luminal A, basal-like tumors had more TP53 mutations (44{\%} vs 15{\%}, P{\textless}.001), higher mitotic index (odds ratio [OR], 11.0; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 5.6-21.7), more marked nuclear pleomorphism (OR, 9.7; 95{\%} CI, 5.3-18.0), and higher combined grade (OR, 8.3; 95{\%} CI, 4.4-15.6). Breast cancer-specific survival differed by subtype (P{\textless}.001), with shortest survival among HER2+/ER- and basal-like subtypes. CONCLUSIONS Basal-like breast tumors occurred at a higher prevalence among premenopausal African American patients compared with postmenopausal African American and non-African American patients in this population-based study. A higher prevalence of basal-like breast tumors and a lower prevalence of luminal A tumors could contribute to the poor prognosis of young African American women with breast cancer.},

abstract = {Intramembrane proteases cleave membrane proteins in their transmembrane helices to regulate a wide range of biological processes. They catalyse hydrolytic reactions within the hydrophobic environment of lipid membranes where water is normally excluded. How? Do the different classes of intramembrane proteases share any mechanistic principles? In this review these questions will be discussed in view of the crystal structures of prokaryotic members of the three known catalytic types of intramembrane proteases published over the past 7 years. Rhomboids, the intramembrane serine proteases that are the best understood family, will be the initial area of focus, and the principles that have arisen from a number of structural and biochemical studies will be considered. The site-2 metalloprotease and GXGD-type aspartyl protease structures will then be discussed, with parallels drawn and differences highlighted between these enzymes and the rhomboids. Despite the significant advances achieved so far, to obtain a detailed understanding of the mechanism of any intramembrane protease, high-resolution structural information on the substrate-enzyme complex is required. This remains a major challenge for the field.},
